		<h1>HOME PAGE</h1>
		<p>This page is the home page for the three websites you see above. For this page specifically, I will give a brief description of who I am, as a person, and I will also describe the other pages in this page as well</p>

		<h2>Resume</h2>
		<p>This page will have my almost-real resume on it. This isn't my real mastery resume but is close to what I can give you. But with what that resume has so far, I know I will be adding more when my life continues on from college to getting jobs after college.</p> 
		<h2>Pizza Recipe</h2>
		<p>This page will show you have to make and cook your own pizza and it will also include a video on how to make one.</p>

		<p>My name is Eduardo Carbo. I am 19 years old and I am an undergraduate at IIT. What I like to do on my free time is either play video games or play sports like basketball and soccer. I was born in Queens, New York and moved to Chicago when I was barely 11 months old and been living here since. I love technology and what you can do with it. It is very versitile and can help us overcome things that can be a burden to us and even make something efficent. <p>
